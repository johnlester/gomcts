An implementation of Monte Carlo Tree Search in Go language

by John Lester

A work in progress

As a test game, I am using a simple game I call 123ToTen. It is a two-player game of perfect information. Players take turns adding 1, 2, or 3 to a common total that starts at 0. The player to get the total to 10 wins. A player that ends their turn with a total of 6 or 2 can force a win.
